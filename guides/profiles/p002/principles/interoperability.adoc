* Organization (Organization/Business):
** This {peppol} eTendering BIS supports only B2G
** This {peppol} eTendering BIS supports cross border, regional and domestic tendering procedures in EU and EEA
** This  {peppol} eTendering BIS can function as a standardized EDI agreement within a trading community

. Technical interoperability
* Technical Interaction (Process and semantic implementation):
** Binding to {link-e-SENS-SBDH}[e-SENS-SBDH]
** {link-e-SENS-SBDH}[ASiC-E container with CAdES signature]
