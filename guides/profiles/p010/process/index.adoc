//ToDo
= Business process and use cases

The following process flows and use cases describe how the {name-profile} can be used. The {link-bpmn}[BPMN] diagram shows the choreography of the business process implemented by the {name-profile}. The choreography of business collaborations defines the sequence of interactions when the profile is run within its context. The use cases detail example types of responses that can be returned by the Message Level Response (MLR).
