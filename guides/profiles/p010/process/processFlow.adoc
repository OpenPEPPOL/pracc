= Business process description

The process starts when a BusinessDocumentSender is preparing an electronic business document and then sends it. The BusinessDocumentReceiver receives the business document, potentially validates syntax and business rules and starts to process the business document.

* In case the BusinessDocumentSender has the capability to receive a TMR, the BusinessDocumentReceiver either:

** Validates the business document and based on the result returns either an accept (no fatal errors and no processing exceptions found), a conditional accept (warnings found) or a reject (fatal errors or processing exception found)

** Doesnâ€™t validate the business document and does not find any processing exceptions and just sends an accept to the sender of the business document.

* If a TMR is returned to the BusinessDocumentSender, it may take appropriate action.

** If the response is positive the BusinessDocumentSender may update the status of the business document or simply ignore the TMR.

** If the response is negative the BusinessDocumentSender may be able to fix the issue and sent an updated version of electronic business document.

** If the response is accepted conditionally the BusinessDocumentSender may be able to analyse and fix the issue for future applications.
