= Introduction to openPEPPOL and BIS

This {link-peppol} BIS provides a set of specifications for implementing a {link-peppol} business process. The document is concerned with clarifying requirements for ensuring interoperability of pan-European Public eProcurement and provides guidelines for the support and implementation of these requirements. This document is based on work done by {link-bii3}.

The {name-profile} describes electronic messaging support for the business process to identify and verify the capabilities of any economic operator that wants to present an offer in a particular tendering procedure (pre-awarding phase). It is for the business process of tendering in a pre-awarding phase. It is intended for use by businesses and purchasing authorities in procedures where access to participation is restricted to pre-qualified economic operators. The key aspects covered by this BIS are:

    * An economic operator can use this BIS to submit qualification documents to a contracting authority as specified in the Call for Tender documents.
    * The BIS can be used for pre-qualification as part of a restricted, negotiated or competitive dialogue tendering procedure or as qualification in an open procedure.
    * The qualification transaction is specific to a particular call for tenders.
    * The contracting authority confirms the reception of the qualification documents.
    * The contracting authority evaluates the qualification information and reports his decision, positive or negative, to the economic operator. The decision reporting is out of the scope of this BIS. In the case of a positive qualification response the contracting authority can continue with the tendering process. The positive qualification response may contain an invitation to submit a tender (not in scope of this BIS).

In an open procedure this profile is not used but the qualification is sent together with the tender, an economic operator submits. Submitting a tender with qualification is defined in {P003}.


The purpose of this document is to facilitate an efficient implementation and increased use of electronic collaboration regarding the tendering process based on these formats.
