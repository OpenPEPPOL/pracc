= Tendering procedures

Individual pre-award processes can be put in place using different procedures, depending on the value and the type of the contract to be awarded, on the legal nature of the contracting body and on specific member state national legislation {link-eu-directive}[(Directive 2014/24/EU art. 26)].

In open procedures, any economic operator can access the tender documents (including the call for tenders) and submit a tender before the time expires, without subscribing for interest and without any previous assessment of their capabilities. In restricted and negotiated procedures and in a competitive dialogue the interested economic operators must submit a request to participate in order to be invited in the tendering process by the contracting body. When the contracting body has published a notice, the interested economic operators may subscribe to obtain tendering information using profile {link-bii3} "BII46  Subscribe to Procedure"(CWA 17027-111). Negotiated procedures require sending the invitation to tender (profile {link-bii3} "BII52  Invitation to Tender"(CWA 17027-117)) to identified candidates.

{link-eu-directive}[Article 26 to 32 from Directive 2014/24/EU] and {link-art43-50}[article 43 to 50 from Directive 2014/25/EU] describe the different tendering procedures that can be used by contracting bodies. For the purpose of electronic tendering, some of these procedures have been described in {link-bii3} "BII37 Open Procedure"(CWA 17027-106) and {link-bii3} "BII39  Restricted Procedure"(CWA 17027-108).

Official notification through publishing bodies is part of many procedures. eNotification covers the electronic transfer of electronic notices for publication and dissemination services with the ultimate aim of opening market opportunities. {link-bii3} profiles "BII14 Prior Information Notice"(CWA 17026-102), "BII10 Contract Notice"(CWA 17026-101) and "BII43 Contract Award Notice"(CWA 17026-103) describe the exchange of a notice between a contracting body or his representative and a publisher.
