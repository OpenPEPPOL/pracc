| Description
| The contracting body sends an electronic invitation to tender document containing the information required for the economic operator to participate in a tendering process.
The contracting body may send a formal invitation to tender as an attachment to the call for tenders document.
The economic operator evaluates the information given with the invitation to tender and decides whether to accept the invitation or to reject it.
If the economic operator accepts the invitation, the business process follows through an external process.
If the economic operator rejects the invitation, no notification needs to be sent back to the contracting body.

| Post-conditions
| The economic operator has received the invitation to tender and can proceed to prepare and submit the qualification or tender.
