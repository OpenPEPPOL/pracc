The {name-profile} describes electronic messaging support for the business process of inviting economic operators in a pre-awarding phase.

The key aspects covered by this profile are:

* The contracting body has decided to invite an economic operator to participate in a tendering procedure, sending the invitation to tender.
* The contracting body makes the Invitation to tender document available to the economic operator
* The economic operator decides whether he participates in the tendering process, but no communication needs to be sent back to the contracting body if he decides not to.
* After having received the invitation to tender, an economic operator can request the status of the procurement project from the contracting body, who provides the economic operator with the latest procurement project call for tender.

In this {name-profile}, most information about the call for tenders is defined in (unstructured) attachments. The purpose of this document is to facilitate an efficient implementation and increased use of electronic collaboration regarding the tendering process based on these formats.
