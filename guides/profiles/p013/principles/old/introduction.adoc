= Introduction

The intended scope for this profile includes public procurement, but the profile may also be used in Business to Business (B2B) relations.

This profile is intended to support transmission of electronic documents for processing in (semi-)automated processes. The legal requirements that were taken into account are requirements from European legislation, in particular the {link-eu-directive}[EU Directive on public procurement].
