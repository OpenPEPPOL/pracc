The `cac:AdditionalDocumentReference` class contains references to all the files for the tenderers to prepare their bids. The mandatory `cbc:ID` element contains an identifier of the file, and the `cac:DocumentStatusCode` is used to inform the tenderer about the action that has to be done with the current document.
