= Definition of the procurement project

The call for tenders in this profile is intended to provide unstructured information of the procurement project. The economic operators are expected to read the provided documents and prepare their tenders following the requirements established as unstructured information.

==	Call for tenders without lots

A Call for tenders without lots has a single `cac:ProcurementProject` class. The procurement project and all the details of the project are described using the documents attached or referred using the `cac:AdditionalDocumentReference` class.

In this case, the document instance must not contain any `cac:ProcurementProjectLot` class.


The example below demonstrates the use of the `cac:ProcurementProject` class for a tendering process without lots. The structured information does not convey economic information. It is used to describe the project, to provide classification codes using the Common Procurement Vocabulary and the location where the project will be executed using the NUTS code.
The procurement project in does not describe the tender deliverables.
