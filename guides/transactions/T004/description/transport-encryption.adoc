= Transport of encryption certificate via the Call For Tenders

== Introduction

The Call For Tenders (CfT) business document is used by the contracting authority to provide an economic operator with the latest updated procurement documents. Besides transporting procurement documents it MUST be used to transport the encryption certificate needed by the economic operator to encrypt his tender for submission.

== Encryption certificate

The encryption certificate MUST be transported as an attachment within the Call For Tenders ASIC. The Call For Tenders business document contains metadata regarding all attachments thus also for the tender encryption certificate.

This metadata is resembled by the UBL container cac:AdditionalDocumentReference. In the case of the encryption certificate this container MUST contain the elements and values mentioned in the table below.

To identify the encryption certificate, the UBL MUST contain exactly one AdditionalDocumentReference-container as described below. Any other container MUST NOT make use of this value combination.
