[IMPORTANT]
Due to legal framework conditions, there is a constraint to tolerate errors to a certain extent when receiving a tender, even if from a technical point of view, the message might have to be rejected. Especially tender rejections have to be kept to a minimum and must be based on valid reasons. These have to withstand judicial review.
