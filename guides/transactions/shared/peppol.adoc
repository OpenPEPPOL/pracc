= PEPPOL Identifiers


PEPPOL has defined a Policy for Using Identifiers that specifies how to use identifiers in both its transport infrastructure and within the documents exchanged across that infrastructure. It also introduces principles for any identifiers used in the PEPPOL environment. The e-Tendering pilot adopts and extends the PEPPOL Policy in the following ways:

== Party Identifiers used in business (UBL) documents
The `@schemeID` attribute must be populated in all instances of the ID element when used within a PartyIdentification-container and in all instances of the EndpointID element when used within a Party-container.

Examples of usage in PartyIdentification and EndpointID:

[source,xml,indent=0]
.Examples of usage in PartyIdentification and EndpointID
----
<cbc:EndpointID schemeID="NL:KVK">12345678</cbc:EndpointID>
..
<cac:PartyIdentification>
	<cbc:ID schemeID="NO:ORGNR">999888777</cbc:ID>
</cac:PartyIdentification>

----

== Document Identifiers used in business (UBL) documents

=== UBL Version ID

This transaction model is using the UBL 2.2 syntax. The namespace of the XML-message does only communicate the major version number. Since it is important for the receiver to also know what minor version of the syntax that is used, the element UBLVersionID must be stated with the value 2.2:

[source,xml,indent=0]
.Examples of usage in PartyIdentification and EndpointID
----
<cbc:UBLVersionID>2.2</cbc:UBLVersionID>
----

=== Profile ID
ProfileID identifies what business process a given message is part of, and are connected to one business process, and may contain multiple document types.

Valid profile identifiers are described in the profile BIS documents. See {link-main-site}.

=== Customization ID

The PEPPOL Customization ID identifies the specification of content and rules that apply to the transaction. This transaction requires some minor additions and changes to the CEN BII transaction. Following the CEN BII methodology any extension must be communicated by adding an extension ID onto the Customization ID.

The full syntax is:
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<transactionId>:(restrictive|extended|partly)
:<extensionId>[(restrictive|extended|partly):<extensionId>]
----

Which customization identification should be used, is based on which transaction is sent, and the extension identification for BIS documents.

NOTE: For implementers, please note that the process identifiers in the document instance MUST correspond to the http://docs.oasis-open.org/bdxr/bdx-smp/v1.0/cs03/bdx-smp-v1.0-cs03.pdf[SMP] process identifier.
