== Electronic Address Identifier scheme of Sender and Receiver

All electronic address identifiers are based upon the Electronic Address Scheme code list (EAS), maintained by CEF (link:https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/Code+lists#Codelists-1[CEF Code lists]).

Electronic address identifiers have a non optional scheme identifier attribute (`@type`) which must be 'EAS'. Valid scheme values are found here: link:/pracc/codelist/EAS/[EAS codes].
