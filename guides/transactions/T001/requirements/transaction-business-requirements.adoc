Platforms that apply this practice make country-specific information optional in the registration process. Platforms also simplify the registration step by requesting information that economic operators can provide without consulting third parties, such as Certification Authorities, chambers of commerce or other business organisations. This way, it is possible to avoid foreign economic operators being prevented from registering." +

* Economic operator ID (such as registration number in the professional registry)
