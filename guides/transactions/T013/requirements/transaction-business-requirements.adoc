The transaction "{name-transaction}" must be sent to the contracting authority when the economic operator has submitted a tender and decided to withdraw the tender. After "{name-transaction}", the bid of the Economic Operator is not evaluated. The tender may be resubmitted if the submission deadline has not passed.

NOTE: Please note that the transaction "{name-transaction}" has to be sent to contracting authorities when an existing tender is withdrawn. As a consequence, the "{name-transaction}" shall be also sent before sending an updated Tender (T005), to ensure that the economic operator receives confirmation of the withdrawal of the old tender (T014), as well as a corresponding confirmation of the submission of a new tender (T006).
